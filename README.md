# ML_Learning_Projects
My Journey through Machine Learning: Projects covering ML fundamentals, regression, classification, EDA, and advanced pipelines using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.


# Machine Learning Engineering Journey

### From Fundamentals to Production-Style Pipelines

This repository documents my **2-week intensive hands-on learning sprint** in Machine Learning.
The focus was not just learning theory, but writing **clean, modular, and professional code** with clear explanations and reproducible workflows.

## Project Goals

* Build strong foundations in Python for Data Science
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on real datasets
* Understand Regression and Classification deeply
* Learn how real ML pipelines are structured
* Implement hyperparameter tuning and modular pipelines
